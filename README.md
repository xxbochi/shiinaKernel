# shiinaKernel
Undetected kernel cheat for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive

# What is shiina?

shiina is my first attempt at a kernel cheat for CSGO. CSGO only uses VAC (Valve Anticheat), which is a usermode ac and has no ability to detect memory editing from the kernel. I've been working on a csgo cheat for a week or two, but after several failed manual mapping attempts for the Dll, I decided to try kernel.

# Features

- no flash
- chams
- bhop (removes a jump check)
- triggerbot (WIP)


# Usage

I honestly have no idea how someone else would use this, there are probably so many dependencies you need to download that I'm not even aware of but this is the launch procedure:

- start shiina driver from cmd
- run CSGO
- run shiina controller
